# Attendance System using Face Recognition with Realtime Database

**Overview**

This project implements an Attendance System using Face Recognition technology integrated with a Realtime Database (e.g., Firebase). The system is designed to automate attendance tracking by detecting and recognizing faces through a live webcam feed. 
The recognized faces are matched with pre-encoded facial data, and attendance is marked in a database. Additionally, employee details such as attendance count, email, phone number, and more are displayed on the user interface.

**1. Features**

**Face Recognition:** Utilizes the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces.
  
**Real-time Database Integration:** Uses Firebase's Realtime Database to store employee details and attendance records.
  
**Employee Details:** Displays information such as total attendance, name, email, phone number, and more for each recognized face.
  
**Automatic Attendance Logging:** Marks attendance in real time when an employee's face is detected.
  
**Scalable & Secure:** Secure integration with Firebase for real-time updates and cloud-based storage.
  
**Image Uploading:** Supports uploading employee images to Firebase Storage for recognition purposes.


**2. Technologies Used**

    i. Python: Core language for the project.

    ii. OpenCV: For image processing and handling webcam feeds.

    iii. face_recognition: For face detection and recognition.

    iv. Firebase Realtime Database: To store employee data and attendance records.

    v. Firebase Storage: For storing employee images.

    vi. Git: For version control and collaboration.


**3. Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

    i. Python 3.x

    ii. OpenCV (cv2)

    iii. face_recognition library
  
    iv. Firebase Admin SDK

    v. Git


**4. How It Works**

  **1. Face Detection and Recognition**

    The system uses OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam.
    Detected faces are encoded and compared with pre-stored facial encodings.
    If a match is found, the employee's details are fetched from Firebase.

  **2. Attendance Marking**

    When an employee's face is recognized, their attendance is automatically marked in the Realtime Database.
    The employee's attendance count is updated, and their details are displayed.

  **3. UI Display**

    A custom user interface is used to show the employeeâ€™s name, attendance count, and other details.
    The system can display an image of the employee alongside their details.
